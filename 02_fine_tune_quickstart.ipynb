The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.\\\\n\\\\nI do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.\\\\n\\\\nThere was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, nice working or socializing environment.  Very friendly and inviting.  It's what I've come to expect from Starbucks, so points for consistency.\"}"

There are certainly things to love . . . the expansive outdoor patio with some of the most comfortable seating around. It's great for people-watching as it fronts Camelback Road, just across the street from Scottsdale Fashion Square. On a hot and hazy summer afternoon, we were still very content sitting on the patio.\\n\\nOn the negative side . . . The food was not even so-so.  I expected so much more from a Sam Fax Restaurant. We have been fans for years with True Food, North, The Greenhouse and the now-closed Bloom, and they are on our regular dining rotation.  Culinary Dropout was how its name sounded, someone dropped the culinary part when they made our meals. I had a hard time finding something that even sounded appetizing on the menu!  We started with the potato chips and onion dip. Nothing to write home about, although I think that if I had a real salt craving, these might just satisfy it. Maybe I should have ordered the pretzel and provolone fondue . . . \\n\\nFor an entree I ordered the ricotta gnocchi with sausage and mushroom . . . sure sounded like a winner . . . NOT! The gnocchi and sauce were pretty tasteless, and the mushrooms and sausage were so salty I couldn't eat them. Mix them all together and it tasted even worse. My husband ordered the Beef Stroganoff and was very disappointed.  There was no sour cream taste whatsoever. Boring was what he called it.\\n\\nSo the food is not up to par with the rest of the Fox restaurants, but the worst part was the service. The place was pretty empty, and while our server was attentive to our needs prior to our order, after our food was delivered, he pretty much disappeared -- no water refills, no iced tea refills . . . nothing. On a 106 degree day, that should never happen on the patio!!\\n\\nNeedless to say, we won't be making any trips back to Culinary Dropout!</td>\n",

The chili was definitely delicious, so if you're really stuck on going here, grab the chili cheese fries and please save yourself the money and skip the dog. I've never been so adamant on telling someone to skip something as I am about this! The bun was stale, the dog itself was bad- it had that POP when you take your first bite, and though I know that is the goal of some places that serve dogs, I know that's not the goal for pinks and I'm pretty sure it poped because it was way overly old and over cooked. I'm sad to have to give a place with such a great reputation in LA such a bad review, but clearly they sold themselves out when coming to Vegas and just got dollar signs in their eyes without making sure the quality followed with them. I seriously have had MUCH BETTER hot dogs at the movie theater. I couldn't even finish my over-priced hot dog because it was THAT BAD. I know I sound like a snob, but I'm not, i promise. I was hungry after having a long day of walking and beers and all I wanted was a delicious juicy hot dog and this was very disappointing. I keep going on but it was that bad. Good luck to you if you ignore this and still get a dog, I pray I just caught them on a really really off and bad day, but from what I understand, I'm not too far off from what others were saying.Sorry friends!</td>\n",

So The Bank is a new club in the Bellagio, which you would assume would be super nice and extravagant.  It's definitely nicely done inside, but not particularly large compared to the more well know/popular clubs in Vegas\\n\\n***************************************************************************************\\nThe BAD:  the unorganized wait to get in.  It was a saturday night that 4 of us went there b/c we wanted to avoid the crowds at the busier places AND we had gotten free passes to get in to this place.  There were somewhere around 30-40 people in line, so we wait for 15-20 minutes before we make it to the very front of the line.  Somehow we end up standing in that position for at least another half hour BECAUSE the guy (Robert?) letting people in is looking for his cash/tips and letting people in based on that.  I totally understand that side of it, but come on how blatant and unfair can you be?!?!?  I feel bad for the groups of all guys next to us that probably waited even longer just because they were complaining to this d*#@-head.   \\n\\nWe waited patiently and eventually got in, but honestly I don't think I'll be coming back to this place unless they change something.  If I were the Bellagio, I would be seriously concerned b/c people are gonna be majorly turned off from coming to this place just b/c of this unorganized / unnecessary waiting.\\n\\nThe GOOD: Once we did get in, it was actually fairly nice inside.  Good size dance floor, a lot of space to people watch, and they have two large bars on opposite sides with some very HOT bartenders- always a PLUS!=)   I have to say their DJ and choice of music was excellent.  On a side note, I had a small \\\"accident\\\" that required some minor medical attention which their staff jumped on quick and was much appreciated (Thanks Phil and Steve!)\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION: I hope this place gets better soon, cuz it does have potential.</td>\n",
